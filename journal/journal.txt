Sat Feb 11 10:46:29 AM EST 2023> test
Sat Feb 11 10:46:44 AM EST 2023> haha, that's what I wanted!
Sat Feb 11 10:47:05 AM EST 2023> probably should have tested it before beginning..
Sat Feb 11 10:49:42 AM EST 2023> anyways, this was for ludum dare 27.
Sat Feb 11 10:50:01 AM EST 2023> unfortunately, I don't think the old submissions from that are still up
Sat Feb 11 10:50:06 AM EST 2023> but you can play the game still
Sat Feb 11 10:50:19 AM EST 2023> anyways, the theme of the competition after the voting period was "10 seconds"
Sat Feb 11 10:50:27 AM EST 2023> there were some really creative interpretations of this
Sat Feb 11 10:50:41 AM EST 2023> for example, there was one game that was like a sprinting race with 11 people
Sat Feb 11 10:50:47 AM EST 2023> and the first person was really fast
Sat Feb 11 10:51:10 AM EST 2023> the game was to control the speeds of the remaining 10 players such that they all finish at the same time - "10 seconds"
Sat Feb 11 10:51:11 AM EST 2023> lol
Sat Feb 11 10:51:55 AM EST 2023> anyway, I created "download simulator 2013"
Sat Feb 11 10:52:02 AM EST 2023> I just noticed it's been 10 years since 2013
Sat Feb 11 10:52:03 AM EST 2023> crazy
Sat Feb 11 10:52:20 AM EST 2023> I wasn't thinking about that, but I suppose it *is* and opportune time to recreate it
Sat Feb 11 10:52:39 AM EST 2023> anyways, I took a more obvious interpretation of the theme. Each of my levels is over in 10 seconds
Sat Feb 11 10:53:48 AM EST 2023> it is heavily inspired by Super Meat Boy. It's 2d platformer where you play a small red square. Jump duration is determined by how long you hold the jump key. Wall jumping is a thing. Friction is low and it requires twitch reflexes and developing muscle memory from losing a bunch
Sat Feb 11 10:54:04 AM EST 2023> I received both praise and criticism during judging for the difficulty
Sat Feb 11 10:54:24 AM EST 2023> I really like games like SMB, but they're definitely not for everyone
Sat Feb 11 10:55:18 AM EST 2023> speaking of which, I saw this video essay recently about "How Speedrunners Conquered The World's Hardest Game" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU851gBd7WQ
Sat Feb 11 10:55:20 AM EST 2023> super interesting
Sat Feb 11 10:55:36 AM EST 2023> and surprisingly engaging. I remember playing this game on the computer in middle school
Sat Feb 11 10:56:09 AM EST 2023> so I'm gonna remake it. I have a bunch of things I want to learn and this is an easy, fun project to try and do that with
Sat Feb 11 10:57:13 AM EST 2023> oh yeah, by the way, it's called 'download simulator' because there is a green bar that moves from the left to right side of the level, which is shaped/sized roughly like a download bar. You cannot allow the "completed" portion of the download bar to touch you, forcing you to get to the goal at the right side of the level before the "download" completes
Sat Feb 11 10:57:26 AM EST 2023> the level names are fake file names
Sat Feb 11 10:57:30 AM EST 2023> intended to sound sketchy
Sat Feb 11 10:57:48 AM EST 2023> for v2, I want the easier levels to have normal sounding file names
Sat Feb 11 10:57:55 AM EST 2023> the sketchiness of the filename will increase with level difficulty
Sat Feb 11 10:59:02 AM EST 2023> okay, here are some thoughts about what else I want from v2, from notes I took in my notebook last night
Sat Feb 11 10:59:05 AM EST 2023> it's a new notebook
Sat Feb 11 10:59:44 AM EST 2023> it was like $10 for 100 pages. It has "Tomoe River Paper" which is supposedly really good for fountain pens. I like it so far. It dries quick and there is no feathering or bleeding
Sat Feb 11 10:59:50 AM EST 2023> which is incredible, considering how thin the paper is
Sat Feb 11 11:00:12 AM EST 2023> it's actually completely blank. No lines. At first I thought that would be a problem, since I intended to use it for writing
Sat Feb 11 11:00:35 AM EST 2023> then, I realized that because the paper is so ridiculously thin, you can put a piece of lined paper behind the page you're on, and see the lines quite clearly
Sat Feb 11 11:00:52 AM EST 2023> so although the page itself is blank, it is still possible to write neatly!
Sat Feb 11 11:00:59 AM EST 2023> ok anyways, here's what I wrote last night:
Sat Feb 11 11:01:07 AM EST 2023> I want to write it in Go
Sat Feb 11 11:01:18 AM EST 2023> probably in a way that can be compiled to webassembly and run in a browser
Sat Feb 11 11:01:58 AM EST 2023> but I like Go and I want to use it to make a game. Most of my games to this point have been in a loosely typed language like JS or Python. I want to be intentional and deliberate about how I build this version out, so that it is modular and reusable for other purposes
Sat Feb 11 11:02:29 AM EST 2023> I want to time levels, and have at least a localstorage to track a player's high score for each level (and perhaps a score history)
Sat Feb 11 11:03:48 AM EST 2023> I want replays. Super meat boy had this really cool thing - after a level is completed successfully, all your attempts were replayed at the same time which had a really cool effect. As time in the replay goes on, more and more of your attempts "die" until there is just the single attempt that succeeded
Sat Feb 11 11:04:01 AM EST 2023> I don't wanna do anything that complex at first. It is sufficient to replay a single attempt
Sat Feb 11 11:04:07 AM EST 2023> that's not really an essential feature imo
Sat Feb 11 11:04:09 AM EST 2023> but whatever
Sat Feb 11 11:04:41 AM EST 2023> idk about music, but it would be a nice option. Even better if it is in some way affected by the level and player events
Sat Feb 11 11:05:07 AM EST 2023> maybe the player could change color every time a new collision occurs. So you'd change color as you wall jumped or something
Sat Feb 11 11:05:27 AM EST 2023> I want to add "game juice" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg
Sat Feb 11 11:05:41 AM EST 2023> probably to start, jumping and landing/colliding should shake the level a little
Sat Feb 11 11:05:59 AM EST 2023> altering the size of the plaer would be cool
Sat Feb 11 11:06:02 AM EST 2023> slightly
Sat Feb 11 11:06:13 AM EST 2023> (not changing the hitbox necessarily, just aesthetic)
Sat Feb 11 11:07:23 AM EST 2023> maybe some "matrix-y" dots in the foreground and background slowly drifting to the right. No interaction with the level. Just some more details to contribute to the idea that you are "inside" a download
Sat Feb 11 11:07:44 AM EST 2023> probably enemies will be necessary at some point to ramp up the difficulty/level of engagement
Sat Feb 11 11:08:01 AM EST 2023> no restriction to 10 seconds in this version. Download bar behavior can be erratic
Sat Feb 11 11:08:09 AM EST 2023> I will probably try to define different download bar movement types
Sat Feb 11 11:08:39 AM EST 2023> e.g. linear, exponential, switch (low speed to high speed at a certain level progress - or high to low)
Sat Feb 11 11:08:48 AM EST 2023> Some levels I would like to move
Sat Feb 11 11:09:07 AM EST 2023> so both the platforms/player would be shifting left (shower than player speed)
Sat Feb 11 11:09:15 AM EST 2023> but the download bar would also be moving left to right
Sat Feb 11 11:09:23 AM EST 2023> once I have something basic I want to work on mobile usability
Sat Feb 11 11:09:27 AM EST 2023> either in web or as an app
Sat Feb 11 11:09:39 AM EST 2023> I want to make level design as easy as possible
Sat Feb 11 11:10:03 AM EST 2023> ideally a web UI or pixel image where each pixel color represents a different type of entity in the level
Sat Feb 11 11:10:18 AM EST 2023> this would generate level structure files which would be parsed by the game
Sat Feb 11 11:10:36 AM EST 2023> I want to implement it with as little state as possible - using a functional style
Sat Feb 11 11:14:25 AM EST 2023> I'm debating between using an existing game engine like https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten or https://github.com/faiface/pixel or writing my own
Sat Feb 11 11:14:44 AM EST 2023> in DS 2013, I basically wrote an engine from scratch
Sat Feb 11 11:15:02 AM EST 2023> it was fun and educational, but engines written by others are probably nice too. I just haven't used them much
Sat Feb 11 11:15:44 AM EST 2023> anyway, I'll see if these game engines can be used in the way I want to write this game
Sat Feb 11 11:15:48 AM EST 2023> if so, I'll probably use them
Sat Feb 11 11:15:54 AM EST 2023> otherwise, building from scratch would work
Sat Feb 11 11:16:04 AM EST 2023> I'll take notes here as I go in case I ever want to track my progress
Sat Feb 11 03:37:48 PM EST 2023> I'm back
Sat Feb 11 03:37:55 PM EST 2023> researching pixel library
Sat Feb 11 03:38:49 PM EST 2023> can't figure out if it runs in the browser
Sat Feb 11 03:38:51 PM EST 2023> but..
Sat Feb 11 03:38:59 PM EST 2023> I still want to learn it
Sat Feb 11 03:47:29 PM EST 2023> ok now I'm actually watching a talk about Gio. I would like to learn that too. If I can draw graphics the way I need to in it, I'd like to use it. But need to learn more first
Sat Feb 11 03:48:18 PM EST 2023> whoa it has one of my coworkers in it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=segijy6UcMI
Sat Feb 11 03:49:59 PM EST 2023> test
Sat Feb 11 03:50:17 PM EST 2023> I moved the journal to a new directory
Sat Feb 11 03:50:41 PM EST 2023> Eventually I'll want it to write to a different file dependent on the date
Sat Feb 11 04:00:54 PM EST 2023> now I'm cloning the "learn-gio" repository and checking out what it can do https://github.com/golangestonia/learn-gio/
Sat Feb 11 04:13:44 PM EST 2023> lol I forgot that dependencies were a thing https://gioui.org/doc/install/linux
Sat Feb 11 04:14:46 PM EST 2023> it's working! There's an animation example so I'm optimistica bout being able to do a game
Sat Feb 11 04:14:53 PM EST 2023> with gio, that is
Sat Feb 11 04:45:18 PM EST 2023> ok, I think I understand the basics at a high level
Sat Feb 11 04:45:24 PM EST 2023> so the premise of this game is that you are inside a download
Sat Feb 11 04:45:55 PM EST 2023> so just so I can get started with gio, I'll try to start mocking up a basic ui for downloading a list of files
Sat Feb 11 05:02:09 PM EST 2023> I found a framecounter in the gio-example repository
Sat Feb 11 05:02:19 PM EST 2023> that seems pretty darn close to a game loop to me
Sat Feb 11 05:02:41 PM EST 2023> I need a nap...
Sat Feb 11 05:02:45 PM EST 2023> probably gonna take a break for now
Sat Feb 11 07:24:47 PM EST 2023> i'm back. nap was good.
Sat Feb 11 08:08:53 PM EST 2023> I found a couple other gio examples I want to draw from
Sat Feb 11 08:09:10 PM EST 2023> the best one is called "component" which has a bunch of examples of widgets I'd like to use
Sat Feb 11 08:09:22 PM EST 2023> and features I probably don't need/won't use. But they're still cool!
Sat Feb 11 08:52:02 PM EST 2023> I got an app bar lol
Sat Feb 11 08:52:15 PM EST 2023> still not where I want it but I have to take a break
Sat Feb 11 10:13:58 PM EST 2023> well I made a commit with the basic UI. I wanna start working on actual game logic soon
Sun Feb 12 04:59:34 PM EST 2023> ok so my coworker helped me figure out some of the things I was struggling with yesterday
Sun Feb 12 04:59:49 PM EST 2023> regarding combining painting on a canvas + gio
Sun Feb 12 05:00:22 PM EST 2023> now I've figured out how to modify it to draw a specific size. I want to maintain a specific aspect ratio for the "download bar", but make it as wide as possible
Sun Feb 12 05:00:33 PM EST 2023> I think that's how the 2013 version was
Sun Feb 12 05:00:57 PM EST 2023> there was a separate coordinate system for the game logic, and this was scaled according to the max size allowed by the screen
Sun Feb 12 05:01:20 PM EST 2023> I'm gonna play around a little bit more with the UI stuff but I really want to get to game logic soon
Sun Feb 12 05:04:36 PM EST 2023> nice, I got the canvas to maintain a specific size, but be middle-aligned
Sun Feb 12 05:05:03 PM EST 2023> I think I'm starting to understand how painting works. It's interesting - I rarely see Go libraries that function like this. I like it
Sun Feb 12 05:05:42 PM EST 2023> actually, replace "rarely see" with "I don't think I've seen"
Sun Feb 12 05:05:56 PM EST 2023> ok a few final tweaks..
Sun Feb 12 05:07:49 PM EST 2023> I used some graph paper to decide what I want the "aspect ratio" for a level to be. 3 by 12 seems good to represent a download bar
Sun Feb 12 05:07:55 PM EST 2023> defining those as constants for now...
Sun Feb 12 05:13:49 PM EST 2023> ok I think I figured that part out
Sun Feb 12 05:17:43 PM EST 2023> now I want to make a watch script to iterate more quickly
Sun Feb 12 05:21:34 PM EST 2023> test watch script
Sun Feb 12 05:24:00 PM EST 2023> test
Sun Feb 12 05:24:33 PM EST 2023> test
Sun Feb 12 05:25:43 PM EST 2023> test
Sun Feb 12 05:39:43 PM EST 2023> lol I totally just killed some important process on my computer by accident while writing the watch script
Sun Feb 12 05:40:01 PM EST 2023> the screen went black and everything was closed. Like if I had just rebooted
Sun Feb 12 06:46:38 PM EST 2023> i'm giving up on the watch script for now
Sun Feb 12 06:47:02 PM EST 2023> apparently just killing the go process is not enough. The UI still stays open, thwarting my efforts
Sun Feb 12 06:47:09 PM EST 2023> so I'm just gonna get down to the game
Sun Feb 12 07:41:00 PM EST 2023> got a player entity and can draw it. Now I need to figure out why the loop is not running
