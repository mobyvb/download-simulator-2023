# Action Plan for Download Simulator 2D Platform Game

1. Design basic game physics and player mechanics
   - Implement core physics (gravity, momentum, character jump, etc.)
   - Create simple player character controller (moving, jumping)

2. Develop level system and concepts
   - Define level dimensions
   - Determine level structure and various obstacles (walls, spikes, etc.)
   - Create a safe zone design and mechanics (trigger when player enters)

3. Implement download bar mechanics
   - Develop green download bar with movement from left to right side of the level
   - Implement player-mobile collision (player must avoid contact)

4. Create level editor and GUI
   - Develop a user-friendly GUI for custom designing levels
   - Implement features for saving and loading levels

5. Design scoring system
   - Implement a timer that tracks time from level start to reaching the safe zone
   - Display score in-game and on level completion

6. Develop game menu system
   - Create main menu with options (start game, level editor, settings)
   - Implement in-level pause menu (resume, restart, return to main menu)

7. Finalize game and level aesthetics
   - Design and implement 2D assets (player character, level backgrounds, objects)
   - Create sound effects and background music

8. Playtesting and balancing
   - Conduct thorough playtests to identify and fix issues (bugs, balancing, etc.)
   - Integrate feedback from playtesters for improvements

## Open Questions

1. How should we approach level difficulty scaling for players of different skill levels?
2. Are there any additional mechanics or power-ups that could increase player engagement?
3. How can we optimize the level editor for efficiency and ease of use for non-designers?
